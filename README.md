# nvim-preview-svg
This plugin was created for visualizing the SVGs embedded (as HTML) in ReactJS, VueJS or, really, in every file. We hope this saves a lot of headaches (and time) for you

## Installation
Using [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)
```
use { 'nmassardot/nvim-preview-svg' }
```

## Usage
Run `:PreviewSvg` and it will open a browser window with the SVG parsed from the active buffer
