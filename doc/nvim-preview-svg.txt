nvim-preview-svg is a plugin for previewing a SVG contained in any file. It saves
you time showing you which SVG are you working with, instead of start guessing
what it can be

Getting started:
  1. Put a `requrie("nvim-preview-svg").setup()` call somewhere in your NeoVim
  config.
  2. Run `:PreviewSvg` to preview the SVG of the current file.
  3. Stonks

nvim-preview-svg.setup({opts})                        *nvim-preview-svg.setup()*
  Setup function to be run by the user. Calling it without the param sets the
  config as default.

  Usage:
  >
  require("nvim-preview-svg").setup({
    browser = "Brave Browser" -- This can be any browser you want (and have)
    args = true -- This is a extra flag for some MacOS versions. If the plugin
                -- doesn't work at first, try setting this to false
  })
